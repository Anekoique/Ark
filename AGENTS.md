# Ark — Agent Guide

A simple CLI agent harness and development workflow for orchestrating AI-driven programming tasks. This file is read by AI coding agents (Codex, Claude Code, etc.) working in **this repository**. Users of the published `ark` CLI should read [README.md](README.md) instead.

## Project at a Glance

- **Crate type:** Rust workspace shipping the `ark` binary.
- **MSRV / toolchain:** pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` (nightly — required for `rustfmt` unstable options).
- **Releases:** automated via `dist` (see `[workspace.metadata.dist]` in `Cargo.toml`); binaries land on GitHub Releases and `@anekoique/ark` on npm.
- **Status:** experimental Phase 0; only Claude Code is targeted as an integration.

### The `ark agent` namespace

`ark agent` is a **hidden** top-level subcommand (`#[command(hide = true)]`) that packages the structural workflow mutations as typed Rust commands. Callers are the shipped slash commands (`templates/claude/commands/ark/*.md`) and the workflow doc; end users should prefer those.

**Stability policy:** the CLI surface under `ark agent` is **not covered by semver**. The contract is internal — the binary and its shipped templates version together, not against external callers. `ark --help` does not list `agent`; `ark agent --help` renders its children with a stability banner.

**Responsibilities of this layer:**
- Create task directories (`task new`) and move them on archive (`task archive`) — whenever the operation touches filesystem structure that has to be correct.
- Transition phases (`task plan` / `review` / `execute` / `verify` / `archive`) — the state machine enforces legality per tier.
- Extract SPEC bodies from PLANs and upsert rows in `specs/features/INDEX.md`'s managed block.

**Not** this layer's responsibility:
- Rare lifecycle operations — iteration and task reopening — the workflow doc tells the agent to hand-edit these. Tier promotion is supported mid-flight via `ark agent task promote`; other ad hoc lifecycle edits remain manual.
- Artifact content (PRD prose, PLAN sections, REVIEW verdicts) — agent's judgment.
- Git / GH operations — agent uses them directly.
- Consistency checks / doctoring — reviewer judgment.

## Build, Test, Lint

```bash
cargo build --workspace
cargo test --workspace
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
```

CI runs all four; PRs that fail any won't merge. Run them before requesting review.

## End-to-End Smoke Test

```bash
cargo build --release
TMP=$(mktemp -d)
./target/release/ark load --dir "$TMP"
./target/release/ark unload --dir "$TMP"
./target/release/ark load --dir "$TMP"
./target/release/ark remove --dir "$TMP"
rm -rf "$TMP"
```

Round-trip must preserve user-edited and user-added files under `.ark/` and `.claude/commands/ark/`.

## Code Conventions

- **Errors:** every fallible op returns `crate::error::Result<T>`. Wrap `std::io::Error` via `Error::io(path, source)`. Never `unwrap()` outside tests; reserve `expect("…")` for documented invariants only.
- **Filesystem:** prefer the methods on `io::PathExt` over `std::fs::*` so error paths stay structured. The trait is implemented for any `T: AsRef<Path>`.
- **Managed blocks** in text files are owned by `io::fs::{read,update,remove}_managed_block` — don't hand-write `ARK:START`/`ARK:END` HTML-comment delimiters elsewhere. The `Marker` helper inside `fs.rs` is private on purpose.
- **Project paths:** route through `layout::Layout` (`ark_dir()`, `claude_md()`, `owned_dirs()`, etc.). Don't `root.join(".ark")` ad-hoc.
- **Commands return summaries that `impl Display`.** The CLI calls one `render(summary)` per dispatch — don't add ad-hoc print logic.
- **Style:** functional combinators (`try_for_each`, `and_then`, `map_or`) where they read more clearly; explicit imperative form where they don't. `cargo fmt` settles all formatting debates.
- **Tests:** every module that does I/O has unit tests using `tempfile::tempdir()`. Round-trip coverage lives in `commands/load.rs::tests`.

## Lifecycle Model (what `ark` does)

| Command      | Effect                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ark init`    | Scaffold `.ark/` + `.claude/commands/ark/` from embedded templates; insert `<!-- ARK -->` block in `CLAUDE.md`; install Ark `SessionStart` hook in `.claude/settings.json`; record artifacts in `.ark/.installed.json`. |
| `ark load`    | If `.ark.db` exists → restore from snapshot (incl. `SessionStart` hook) and remove it. Otherwise → behave like `init`. Refuses if `.ark/` exists; `--force` wipes first.                            |
| `ark unload`  | Capture every file under owned dirs, every recorded managed block, AND the Ark `SessionStart` hook into `.ark.db`; remove the live footprint. Ignoring `.ark.db` in VCS is the user's responsibility. |
| `ark remove`  | Unconditional wipe of `.ark/`, `.claude/commands/ark/`, managed blocks, `.ark.db`, and the Ark `SessionStart` hook entry (sibling user hooks preserved).                                                                                  |
| `ark upgrade` | Refresh embedded templates to the current CLI version; user-modified files are preserved (prompt) or overridden by `--force` / `--skip-modified` / `--create-new`. Re-applies `CLAUDE.md` block and `SessionStart` hook unconditionally (not hash-tracked).      |
| `ark context` | Print a structured snapshot of git + `.ark/` workflow state. Read-only. `--scope session` (default) for orientation; `--scope phase --for {design\|plan\|review\|execute\|verify}` for phase-targeted slices. JSON via `--format json`. |

User-authored files inside owned dirs (`.ark/tasks/...`, custom slash commands) survive an `unload` → `load` round-trip losslessly.

## When Editing Templates

`templates/` is embedded into the binary at build time via `include_dir!`. Any change requires a rebuild for it to take effect. The integration tests in `commands/init.rs::tests` assert specific paths exist — update them when you add or remove template files.

## Reference Material

- `reference/` mirrors third-party projects we study (trellis, openspec, spec-kit, superpowers, agents-cli, etc.). **Treat it as read-only**; don't edit anything under `reference/`.
- Design history and roadmap notes live in `docs/`.

## What Not to Do

- Don't add files just to host one function. Single-responsibility helpers belong in the module that owns the responsibility (see `Marker` private to `io/fs.rs`).
- Don't introduce `crate::*::*` paths that bypass `layout::Layout` for path computation.
- Don't shell out to git, `mv`, or `rm` from Rust code — use `PathExt`.
- Don't mutate `reference/` or commit anything from `target/`.
